This project was created as the final project for a class I took at the University of South Florida during the summer 2025 semester called Database Design and Administration.
It is divided into two SQL script files: the first file, titled Lumon Database Design, details the creation of this database. The second script file showcases the subsequent insertion of
data rows and queries made to showcase connections that can be made across the tables within this relational database.
